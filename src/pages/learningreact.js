                    Before I got into physics and did my degree, I taught myself web programming. On the front-end
                    I primarily used jQuery and blueprint, back-end was PHP. I did a couple of websites,
                    <a href="http://www.planeball.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> one</a> of which
                    has survived to this day(though in quite different form)!
                    </span>

                    <span>Since I discovered that I don't want a life in physics research, I've decided to brush up
                    on my (practical) coding skills. And, if you are reading this, you're looking at my first venture
                    into React.
                    </span>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
};
